# Quantum-AI Integration Demo ðŸ’»ðŸ¤–

This project demonstrates a hybrid quantum-classical workflow by integrating **Q#**, Microsoftâ€™s quantum programming language, with a simple **artificial intelligence (AI)** model implemented in Python. The Q# code generates quantum random bits using a quantum simulator, which are then used to influence a synthetic dataset for training a classical machine learning model (logistic regression). This showcases how quantum computing can enhance AI tasks, such as providing high-quality randomness for data augmentation or stochastic processes.

## Project Purpose
The goal is to provide an educational example of combining quantum computing with AI. Specifically:
- **Quantum Component**: Q# generates random bits via quantum superposition and measurement, leveraging the inherent randomness of quantum mechanics.
- **AI Component**: Python uses these quantum random bits to create a synthetic dataset, which is used to train and evaluate a logistic regression model.
- **Hybrid Workflow**: Demonstrates a basic quantum-classical integration, where quantum randomness feeds into a classical AI pipeline.

This project is a proof-of-concept, not a production-ready application, and serves as a starting point for exploring quantum-enhanced AI.

## Features
- Generates true random bits using a Q# quantum circuit with Hadamard gates.
- Uses quantum random bits to influence a synthetic dataset for AI training.
- Trains a logistic regression model on the dataset and evaluates its accuracy.
- Runs on Microsoftâ€™s Quantum Development Kit (QDK) simulator, with potential for real quantum hardware via Azure Quantum.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- **Quantum Development Kit (QDK)**: Install Q# and the QDK. Follow [Microsoftâ€™s setup guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk).
- **Python 3.8+**: Install Python and required libraries.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `qsharp`: For running Q# code in Python.
  - `scikit-learn`: For the logistic regression model.
  - `numpy`: For data manipulation.
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code with the Q# extension, Jupyter Notebook with Q# kernel, or a Python IDE.
- **Optional**: Access to Azure Quantum for running on real quantum hardware (not required for simulator-based demo).

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install qsharp scikit-learn numpy
```

## Project Structure
```
Quantum-AI-Demo/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ QuantumRandom.qs    # Q# code to generate quantum random bits
â”œâ”€â”€ QuantumAI.py        # Python code for AI model and quantum integration
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Project documentation (this file)
```

- **QuantumRandom.qs**: Defines Q# operations to generate random bits using quantum superposition and measurement.
- **QuantumAI.py**: Integrates Q# random bits with a logistic regression model, creating and evaluating a synthetic dataset.

## Setup
1. **Install QDK**: Follow Microsoftâ€™s guide to set up Q# and the QDK for your platform.
2. **Install Python Dependencies**: Run the `pip install` command above.
3. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository or download the project files.
4. **Verify Environment**: Ensure Q# and Python are configured correctly by running a simple Q# program (e.g., via VS Code or Jupyter).

## Usage
1. **Place Files**: Ensure `QuantumRandom.qs` and `QuantumAI.py` are in the same directory.
2. **Run the Python Script**:
   ```bash
   python QuantumAI.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Compile and simulate the Q# code to generate 100 quantum random bits.
   - Create a synthetic dataset influenced by these bits.
   - Train a logistic regression model and print its accuracy and sample predictions.
3. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   Quantum Random Bits: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...]
   AI Model Accuracy: 0.65
   Sample Predictions: [0 1 0 0 1]
   Actual Labels: [0 1 1 0 1]
   ```
   (Note: Output varies due to randomness and dataset size.)

## How It Works
1. **Q# Quantum Randomness**:
   - The `GenerateRandomBit` operation creates a qubit, applies a Hadamard gate for superposition, measures it, and returns a random `0` or `1`.
   - The `GenerateRandomBits` operation generates an array of random bits by repeating the process.
   - Quantum randomness is inherently non-deterministic, unlike classical pseudo-random generators.

2. **Python AI Integration**:
   - The `qsharp` library runs the Q# code and retrieves random bits.
   - A synthetic dataset (100 samples, 2 features) is created, with labels flipped based on quantum random bits.
   - A logistic regression model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%, demonstrating a simple AI task.

3. **Quantum-AI Synergy**:
   - Quantum random bits simulate how quantum computing can enhance AI by providing true randomness for tasks like data augmentation, sampling, or optimization.
   - The demo is a simplified example but illustrates a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline.

## Limitations
- **Simulator-Based**: Uses the QDK simulator, not real quantum hardware. Running on actual quantum devices requires Azure Quantum access.
- **Simple AI Model**: Logistic regression is basic; real-world applications might use neural networks or quantum machine learning models.
- **Small Dataset**: The demo uses a small dataset (100 samples), limiting model performance.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed for learning, not to demonstrate quantum advantage over classical methods.

## Next Steps
To extend this project:
- **Real Quantum Hardware**: Use Azure Quantum to run Q# code on quantum devices, observing noise effects.
- **Advanced AI Models**: Integrate with frameworks like **PennyLane** for quantum machine learning, e.g., training a variational quantum classifier.
- **Larger Datasets**: Scale to real-world datasets (e.g., image or text data) for practical applications.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Explore quantum kernel methods or quantum-enhanced optimization for AI tasks.
